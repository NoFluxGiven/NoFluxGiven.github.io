Those that have, and attempted to use force to open it, were met with failure, or worse, catastrophic results.\n\n* Two grave robbers entered the chamber after finding the door cracked open, only to emerge an hour later babbling and incoherent. They were admitted to the nearest hospital and recovered within a day or two, but refused to speak of what happened.\n\n* A researcher tried to dig beneath the chamber. After amassing a crew of eight men, and spending nearly 12 hours, they looked up from their digging to find they had barely progressed one metre.\n\n* Multiple attempts to open the [[arcane lock|Arcane Lock]] mechanism on the door have failed spectacularly, including one instance where a mage disintegrated and reapparated about 400 metres above the tomb. Another instead [[transmutated|Transmutation]] a nearby blade of grass into a tiny goat. The goat is kept in the [[Council]]'s living quarters, in a tiny paddock.\n\n* Anyone with malicious intent, or those who wish to destroy the tomb usually cannot even see it. An inebriated demolition mage, for the purpose of a bet, attempted to throw a powerful demolishing spell at the tomb, only to have it deflected. The deflection transsorced the spell into bouquet of [[Snapweeds]].\n\n* The [[Council]] organised a huge gathering of high level mages to attempt to enter the tomb in any way possible. After 2 days, it was revealed all 100 participants were practising magicks on a barn nearby instead. They were completely unaware of this fact until one participant broke the illusion and informed the others.\n\nThe [[Council]] has not ordered any further attempts.",
